# My Hobby Webpage

## A webpage to show off my favourite hobby with some insider info and details.

### Intro:
We received a task to do a capstone project about what we learned about HTML and CSS. The topic for the capstone project is to build a webpage to show off your hobby or something that is of interest to you. There are a set of criteria that we need to include in the build of the webpage to demonstrate our skills in the whole exercise.

#### Project Criteria and How the webpage works:
Project minimum criteria:
  1. html file that is the landing page.
  2. at least two other pages linked to index.
  3. within the entire site:
      - At least 5 images.
      - At least 3 font sizes.
      - At least 2 external links (maybe to another website, or an email ddress).
      - At least 1 table.
      - At least 1 list (ordered or unordered, you can choose).
      - At least one submit button form (possibly to subscribe to a newsletter — don’t worry about the functionality of this yet).
      - At least one radio button form (e.g. you could ask a future subscriber what types of recipes they’d like to receive).
      - At least one quote/testimonial.
      - At least 2 blocks (i.e text with a background).
How the page works:
* The webpage will launch from a simple html file named index.html
* The page will open and land on a big image of Pebble Beach golf course with a welcome message at the top header.
* Below the landing image is a quotes block with a few popular quotes of famous golfers around the world.
* In the header of the index page is two links that will take you to the other two pages.
* The first page is named: SA TOP 10 Courses and the second link is named: Whats's in The Bag.
* If you click on the SA Top 10 Courses link, the next page will open with a table and details of the top 10 best golf courses in South Africa all ranked by Top100 LTD.
* In the header of the Top 10 courses page you will also see two links. There will be a Home link to take you back to the main landing page. And the second link will take you to the second page of What's in the bag page.
* With these links you can jump and navigate between pages.
* If you click on the What's in the bag link, the second page will open with anoter table at the top.
* This table will feature what is inside my personal golf bag and what I have in my kit.
* Just below the kit table is the next criteria requirement of external links to other pages. Here we used a shopping option and displayed links to shopping websites.
* The last requirement was to have a block for subscribers. We have radio buttons to choose what type of communication they would like to receive. Then they need to enter their email address, their name and hit the subscribe button.

##### Installation & Usage Works:
This is a html webpage file and does not require a formal installation process. But the guide below will explain how to make sure you can launch and view the webpage.
1. Clone the repository: my-Hobby to your local machine.
2. Make sure you download the two folders: images and styling to a directory of your choice.
3. Download the index.html, Top10Courses.html and WITB.html files and place it the the root where the images and styling folders are.
4. Note that the index.html, Top10Courses.html, WITB.html files, images folder and styling folder should all be on the same level.
5. Now you can open the index.html file with any browser like Edge or Chrome.
